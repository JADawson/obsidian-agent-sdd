# Obsidian Project Assets

Authoritative, versioned assets for this project live here:

- `.obsidian/templates/` — Markdown templates for note types (Idea, Goal, Project, Area, Activity Plan)
- `.obsidian/prompts/` — Project-owned prompts for Copilot workflows
- `.obsidian/scripts/powershell/` — Scripts and helpers (dry-run, idempotent, vault-safe)
- `.agent/logs/` — Operation traces and diffs (ignored by VCS)

This repository treats `.specify/` and the original `.github/` as reference only. All operational changes occur under `.obsidian/`.
