# Obsidian Agent Prompts

This folder contains project-owned prompts for the Obsidian Agent SDD framework.

- Authoritative project prompts belong here (e.g., obsidian.create.idea, obsidian.create.project,
  obsidian.elaborate, obsidian.clarify, obsidian.challenge).
- The original Spec-Kit prompts under `.github/prompts/` are retained locally as reference
  but should be ignored by version control per the constitution (v0.3.0).
- Keep prompt files versioned and include a brief header with purpose and inputs.
