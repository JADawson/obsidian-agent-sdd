# Virtual Vault (Test Only)

This folder simulates an Obsidian vault for development and testing.

Structure:
- Projects/
- Areas/
- Reference/
  - Ideas/
- Archive/

Notes:
- Use this virtual vault for dry-runs and local testing.
- Real vault paths can be configured later; scripts should remain idempotent and safe.
- You can add this folder as a vault in Obsidian or open it in VS Code alongside the repo.
